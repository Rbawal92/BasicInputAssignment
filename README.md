# Basic Input Assignment - Video Game Fun With Pokemon.
## Overview
This program is a simple C++ input and output using `cin` and `cout`.
It prompts the user for their favorite game, favorite character, gaming platform, and age first time playing the game.
Once the user enters their reponse, the program prints a **personalized message** and comparess to code creators experience.
Than a small calculation that shows age  **age difference** between user and creator.
**warning** You may be given negative number due to no **if or else statements**.

## Program Description
This project was inspired by my love for **Pokémon Red** and the nostalgia of playing on my **GameBoy Color**.  
It uses basic **C++ variables, constants, and input/output ** to collect data from the user and display a short story to feel engaging.

**Concepts demonstrated:**
- String input and output using `cin` and `cout`
- Basic arithmetic calculation (`ageDifference = age - childAge`)
- Constant variable declaration (`const int childAge = 7`)
- Formatted and user-friendly text output

## How to Use

### Input Example:
Enter the name of your favorite video game and your favorite character.
Example: Super_Mario Mario
Super_Mario Mario

Enter the gaming platform you use to play and your age you started playing that game.
Example: Nintendo_Switch 10
Nintendo_Switch 10

### Output Example:
You were 10 years old and loved to play the game Super_Mario on the game system Nintendo_Switch.
Your favorite character from that game is Mario.
The difference of age when we found our favorite game is 3 years!

My favorite game of all time is Pokémon Red, more for the nostalgia factor.
My favorite character was Charizard, but I loved Gyarados as well.
I used to play it on my GameBoy Color when I was your age of 7 years old!
I remember using dial-up internet to cheat and find the Missingno glitch!
